### 4. Create GitHub Repository

#### Option A: GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not installed
# brew install gh  # macOS
# or visit: https://cli.github.com/

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Create repository
gh repo create echo-chamber-experiments --public --description "🌊 Dynamic Belief Evolution Framework - Advanced crisis scenario modeling for computational social science research"

# Push to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/echo-chamber-experiments.git
git push -u origin main
```

#### Option B: GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in
2. Click "New Repository" 
3. **Repository name**: `echo-chamber-experiments`
4. **Description**: `🌊 Dynamic Belief Evolution Framework - Advanced crisis scenario modeling for computational social science research`
5. **Public** repository
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

Then connect locally:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/echo-chamber-experiments.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 5. Verify Upload
```bash
# Check remote connection
git remote -v

# Verify push was successful
git log --oneline -3
```
